        <div class="text"> <p>For the course Bespoke Design, we got the opportunity to design a gift experience for Hallmark.nl. We worked in teams of two and each got a user to interview. From there on we could design a personalised digital unwrapping experience, and the tool to create the experience with. At the end of the course a few teams were selected to pitch their concept to Hallmark in an EXPO and we were happy to hear our concept won! </p>

        <div class="text_2"> <p> We created an experience to send your love through a recipe. This recipe will trigger a specific memory and feeling of that day you had the recipe together with your loved one. The ingredients would be send to your loved one in a box, on the box a barcode will send you to an online experience to start cooking. I designed the tool to create the recipe and the box with.  </p>

        <div class="text_3"> <p> To create our prototype, I used Adobe Xd. In a previous course in this first year of the UXD study, I learned how to work with this tool for the first time. Now during the Bespoke Design Project I got to practice more with it.  </p>
