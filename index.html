        <div class="text"> <p>Iâ€™m a 24 year-old UXD student. This year I started the international UXD studies at The Hague University of Applied Sciences. I chose to follow the international studies, instead of the Dutch spoken studies, because it seemed far more interesting to get to know, and work together with, international classmates. This way I can learn more about international communication and improve my English by using it on a daily basis. </p>
          <p> What I enjoy most is the designing and organising the lay-out of pages, giving a cohesive vibe throughout a page or design. My style is mostly very bright, colourful and clear. </p>
          <p> I am positive and creative and try to work with what I get. Designs should be handmade by their designer and not designed with a template. I prefer designs to be one of a kind, with a personal touch. </p>
